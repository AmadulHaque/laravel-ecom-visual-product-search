   - Configure API credentials in Laravel
   - Create service classes for API communication
   - Implement error handling and rate limiting

4. **Vector Storage Setup**
   - Choose vector database (Pinecone for simplicity)
   - Set up database/service account
   - Create migration for storing vector embeddings locally (as backup)
   - Implement vector storage and retrieval logic

### Phase 3: Search Implementation (Week 3-4)

5. **Core Search Logic**
   - Build image-to-vector conversion pipeline
   - Implement similarity search algorithms
   - Create ranking and filtering mechanisms
   - Add caching layer for performance

6. **API Development**

10. **Analytics and Monitoring**
    - Search analytics tracking
    - Performance monitoring
    - Error logging and alerting
    - A/B testing framework

## Technical Architecture Details

### Data Flow
1. **Image Upload**: User uploads image → Laravel validates → Store in S3
2. **Processing**: Extract features via AI service → Generate vector embedding
3. **Storage**: Store vector in vector database + metadata in MySQL/PostgreSQL
4. **Search**: Query vector → Find similar vectors → Retrieve product details
5. **Results**: Rank and filter → Return to frontend

### Database Schema Design
```
Products Table:
- id, name, description, price, category_id, brand_id, created_at, updated_at

Product_Images Table:
- id, product_id, image_path, image_url, is_primary, created_at

Image_Vectors Table:
- id, product_image_id, vector_id, embedding_metadata, created_at

Search_Logs Table:
- id, user_id, query_image_path, results_count, search_time, created_at
```

### Performance Considerations

**Caching Strategy**
- Redis for frequently searched vectors
- CDN for image delivery
- Application-level caching for search results

**Scalability Planning**
- Horizontal scaling for API servers
- Vector database sharding
- Image processing queue system
- Load balancing for search requests

## Cost Analysis & Recommendations

### Budget-Friendly Approach
- **Feature Extraction**: CLIP (self-hosted) or Google Vision API (pay-per-use)
- **Vector Storage**: PostgreSQL with pgvector
- **Image Storage**: Local storage + CDN
- **Estimated Monthly Cost**: $50-200 for moderate traffic

### Production-Ready Approach
- **Feature Extraction**: Google Vision API or AWS Rekognition

- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for search results
- **User Engagement**: >60% click-through rate on results
- **System Performance**: 99.9% uptime, <100ms API response
- **Cost Efficiency**: <$0.10 per search operation

## Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks**
- API rate limiting: Implement caching and fallbacks
- Vector database downtime: Local backup storage
- Image processing failures: Queue retry mechanisms

**Business Risks**
- High operational costs: Monitor usage and optimize
- Poor search accuracy: A/B test different AI services
- Scalability issues: Plan for horizontal scaling early

This architecture provides a solid foundation for implementing image-based product search while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements and scaling requirements.
